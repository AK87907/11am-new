Any Element in css is treated as Box
A Box contains
  -- i. border: border defines the outermost line of a box
  border: border-size border-style(solid/dashed/dotted/double) color;
  we can also give border-left,border-right etc..,
  borders can also have radius(corner radius)
  border-radius:size; it applies to all corners.
  we can also assign border-top-left-radius, border-top-radis-radius etc..,
  -- ii. margin: it is the space outside the border
  margin:size; it applies all sides
  margin:size1 size2; size1 is for top and bottom, size2 is for left and right
  margin-left,marigin-right,margin-bottom,margin-top also can be used
  -- iii. padding: we can specify padding exactly same as margin. but padding is space inside the box
when we give padding it may increase height & width
To resolve it we can use box-sizing:borde-box
