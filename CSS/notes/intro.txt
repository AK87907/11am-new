CSS(cascading style sheets): css were started in 1994 and used to design,style,layout the web pages.
There are three ways we can implement css into HTML
 i. inline Styling: it is the most powerful way and using this , we can implement styles inside the line of HTML element.Here style is given as attribute
 <h1 style="background-color: blue;color: white;">Hello CSS</h1>
 <!-- create a div with your name and assign styles bgcolor,color using inline -->

 ii. internal styling : In this styling, style works a element. we declare style in head and defines styles using some selectors
  <style>
        h1{
            background-color: blue;
            color: white;
        }
    </style>
    <!-- create some paragraph to describe your data and give color,bgcolor to them using internal css -->

  iii. External CSS: Sometimes it's difficult to manange HTMl,CSS in single file, in that times, we can use external CSS where we write css in .css files and link them to HTMl
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

inline>internal=external
any time more preference is for !important


2. we can assign CSS to some specific elements by selecting them using selectors
basic selectors:
tag selector: you can select elements of similar tag using tag name
class name: we can select elements with similar class name using .classname
id: we can select element with id using #id
id>class>tag

Basics of Design:
A Good Design will be always minimal,interactive and brand associate
it should represent brand by colors,fonts,units
colors: colors represent an emotion,connection that brand wants to convey
colors can be assigned by name,hex code,rgb,rgba,hsl,gradients(linear/radial)

Fonts: Fonts speak profeesionality. there are 5  font families in the world
  i. serif -- serif fonts will have strokes at the end of letters eg: times new roman
  ii. sans serif  -- sans means no. so sans serif fonts will not strokes eg:Arial
  iii. monospace -- these fonts are of same height letters eg:roboto
  iv. cursive  -- these are stylish letters with some chain linking
  v. fantasy/modern
  references: dafonts,1001 fonts, google fonts
units: Any property in CSS can be measured by some units like
px -- pixels -- pixel is the smallest unit based on device specification(heightXwidth)
em -- enumerated value -- it is x times of parent's font Size
rem -- root enumerated value -- it is x times of body's fontSize(by default body font size 16px)
vh,vw -- viewport height,viewport width -- it is the visible height and width of the screen
% -- you can always specify x% of parent
