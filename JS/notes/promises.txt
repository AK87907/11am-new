Why do we need promises?
  Before Js starts promises, js handles some situations using callbacks, it leads to a probelm called "callback hell"
what is a promise?
Promise is an object which defines an eventual completion
of an Asynchronous operation
Promise can be resolved or rejected 
A promise undergoes three states:
  i. fulfilled: if a promise is resolved , it goes to the fulfilled state
  ii. rejected: if a promise is rejected, it goes to the rejected state
  iii. pending: until resolved or reject, it will be in pending state

if a promise is resolved , we can get the result/perform some action in "then"
if a promise is rejected, we can get the result/perform an action in "catch"
