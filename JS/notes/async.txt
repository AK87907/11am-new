Asynchronous Javascript(AJAX):
  Js is synchronous(line by line) single threaded(one task at a time) language

  Asynchronous Javascript makes the code wait for a specific time. it takes time to run
  Asynchronous can also means run specifically.

  We can understand Asynchronous by Timers
  Every Browser Provides a webAPI for Timers such as 
  setTimeout: setTimeout accepts two argument mainly i.e., callback function and timer in ms
 Eg: function fun(){console.log("fun working")}
   setTimeout(fun,2000)
it will run fun function after 2 seconds
  setInterval:setInterval accepts two argument mainly i.e., callback function and timer in ms
   Eg: function fun(){console.log("fun working")}
   setInterval(fun,2000)
it will run fun function for every 2 seconds
To stop timeout or interval we can use clearTimeout(variable) 
and clearInterval(variable)

Javascript provides a datatype called "Date"
Date object will give current date,time,timezone respectively
you can use different methods to print,date , time, month,year etc..,
