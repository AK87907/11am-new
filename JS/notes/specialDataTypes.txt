We have several datatypes which are used to store specific datatypes.The special datatypes in JS are:
  i. Map:  Map is a data structure that stores key-value pairs similar to objects but with some differences:
    keys can be any data type,
    keys are unique
    Maps follows an order in insertion

    const m = new Map();
console.log(m)
m.set('name', "prasad")
m.set(20, 25)
m.set('name', 'Raj')
console.log(m.get('name'))
  ii. Set : Set is a data structure that stores unique values similar to array with differences:
    -- values are unique
    -- Sets do not contain specific order
const s = new Set();
console.log(s);
s.add(5);
s.add(6);
s.add(5);
console.log(s.size)
  iii.Symbols:
Symbols are primitive data types used as a unique identifier
They can be created using Symbol() function

  iv. RegExp:
  Regular Expressions are used to create and test a pattern
These patterns helps to identify passwords,email verifications etc..,

Reg expressions are embraced between / and /
it uses following symbols for validation

eg: let x= /[0-9]{10}/,
        x= /\+\d{1,4}-[0-9]{10}/
