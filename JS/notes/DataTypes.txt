Data types:
Javascript is dynamically typed language
it have classfication of two types
 i. primitive data types:
   a. number: Any numerical value is condsidered as number data type
   eg:5,6.235, e,0 etc..,
     -- toFixed() : it rounds up value to certain digits after decimal
     -- toPrecision() : it rounds up value to certain digits significantly
     -- toString(): it can convert number to string or any other base number
     we can also use math methods like sqrt,cbrt,abs,ceil,floor,random,pow,max,min
   b. string:In js, we can use strings in three ways
     -- single quotes
     -- double quotes
     --In js, there is no difference between single or double quote
     -- backticks
     -- using backtick can provide dynamic values inside the string , usually dynamic values embraced by ${}. this is called template literal
     strings are primtive data type and strings are immutable
    strings have some default functions
     --- toUpperCase() -- It is used to convert given string into Uppercase
     --- toLowerCase() -- It is used to convert given string into toLowerCase
     * strings store characters in the form array indexing
     --- charAt(index)  -- returns the character in that particular index
     --- length -- length is used to return the no.of characters in a given string
     --- indexOf(char) -- returns first occurence index of given char in string
     --- lastIndexOf()  -- returns last occurence index of given char in string
     --- slice(starting,ending) -- used to cut the given string based on starting and ending indexes
     --- split(char)  -- used to divide the string based on given char
     --- join(char)  -- used to join the characters based on given char
     --- startsWith/endsWith()  -- returns true/false based on given char starting/ending in the string or not
     --- concat()  -- used to combine strings
     --- match()  -- returns the first match of given regular expression
     --- includes() --- true/false based on char existence in given string
   c. boolean:  boolean is used to return/store true or false. 
   true can be converted as 1 and false as 0.
   d. undefined: it is an accidental absence of value. it expects value in future
   e. null: it is intenstion absence of value.
 ii. non-primitive data types or referece data types
   a. Arrays
   b. objects
   c. functions
